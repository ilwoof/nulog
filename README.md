This is the code for the paper "Self-supervised Log Parsing" accepted at ECML-PKDD 2020.

The libraries needed are listed in requirements.txt

The main code for the parser is written in /logparser/NuLog/NuLogParser.py.

The experiments are written in /Benchmark/*\*_benchmark.py*

To execute all the experiments please run all /Benchmark/*\*_benchmark.py* scripts.

The previous implemented algorithms for log parsing and the datasets are completely cloned from:
